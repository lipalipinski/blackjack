# Blackjack
## by JL (lipabass@gmail.com)

Python 3.9.7

Inspired by a bootcamp assignment. Original requirements:

> * You need to create a simple text-based BlackJack game
> * The game needs to have one player versus an automated dealer.
> * The player can stand or hit.
> * The player must be able to pick their betting amount.
> * You need to keep track of the player's total money.
> * You need to alert the player of wins, losses, or busts, etc...
>
> And most importantly:
>
> * You must use OOP and classes in some portion of your game. You can not just 
> use functions in your game. Use classes to help you define the Deck and the 
> Player's hand. There are many right ways to do this, so explore it well!

I have created some tests using unittest module in **test.py**.
